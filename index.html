<div class="about" id="about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am a dedicated landscape architect with 2 years of experience in creating innovative and sustainable outdoor spaces. 
    My journey in landscape architecture began with a degree in Landscape Architecture from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology(JKUAT), where 
    I developed a deep appreciation for the harmony between nature and design. I believe in creating landscapes that not only meet the needs of clients but 
    also contribute positively to the environment and community.
